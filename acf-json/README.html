<h1 id="whatisthisfolder">What is this folder?</h1>

<p>If you use Advanced Custom Fields (and you should), you can store your field data in json format with your theme using the ACF <strong>Local JSON</strong> feature.</p>

<p>All you need is a folder in your theme called <code>acf-json</code>. ACF will create or update a json file in this folder with field group settings and data.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s great about this is that you can now keep all of your field data under version control with the theme.</p>

<p>Instead of forgetting to add this folder with each project, I&#8217;m now including it with Plate by default so it will be at the ready.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t use ACF or don&#8217;t need this, just delete it. I mean, GOSH, it&#8217;s just a folder.</p>
